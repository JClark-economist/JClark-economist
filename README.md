# Hello everyone! 👋

My name is Jean Clark, I am a 22 years old French/British economist with some strong data science skills (I still have a lot to learn though). I am experienced with R, Python, machine learning and also VBA.

## 🌱 What do I do?

* ✔️ Having graduated from a Bachelor's degree in Economics at the University of Tours, I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Business Economics with a strong data science component (Master Mécen) and with an expected graduation in September 2021.
* ✔️ With my fellow classmates from university we created a student managed company, the Junior Études Mécen, specialised in data science and which I have the honour to manage as President.
* ✔️ I have been playing rugby at a national level since I was 18 years old, this helped me a lot in the process of becoming a persevering and hard-working man as I had to balance the heavy workload from my studies, the performances I had to deliver on the field and my personal life.
* ✔️ I am looking for an internship in data science.


## 🔭 What am I currently working on?

I am currently expanding my Python skills with a webscraping project on housing data for the Banque of France
